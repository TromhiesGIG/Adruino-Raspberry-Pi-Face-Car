# 🎓 Raspberry Pi Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a lightweight **face recognition-based attendance system** designed to run efficiently on a **Raspberry Pi** using **OpenCV** and **Python**.

It allows you to:
- 🧑‍💻 Register new users by capturing face data
- 🧠 Train a recognition model
- 🧾 Automatically log attendance into a `.csv` file with timestamp
- 🖥️ Use a USB or Pi camera to interact live with the system

## ⚙️ Requirements

Ensure the following are installed on your **Raspberry Pi OS**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-opencv libatlas-base-dev -y
pip3 install numpy pandas
````

If using OpenCV on low-RAM systems:

```bash
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python-headless
```

---

## 📸 Camera Setup

You can use:

* USB Webcam (default index `0`)
* Or Raspberry Pi Camera Module (enable via `sudo raspi-config`)

If using the Pi camera:

```bash
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_V4L2)
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Launch the System

```bash
cd "Raspberry Pi files"
python3 Main.py
```

### Step 2: Use Menu Options

```
[1] Check Camera               → Tests camera feed
[2] Capture Faces              → Takes 30 samples per user
[3] Train Images               → Trains a model using saved faces
[4] Recognize & Attendance     → Logs recognized faces to CSV
[5] Quit                       → Exit system
```

## 📝 How Attendance Works

* Attendance is saved as:
  `Attendance/attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

* Each entry includes:

  * Time of recognition
  * User ID
  * Name (from `names.txt`)

* Duplicates are avoided:
  A user won't be logged again within 10 seconds.

---

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

* Haarcascade model is used for face detection (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`)
* `LBPHFaceRecognizer` is used for training and prediction
* Training images are stored in `Dataset/` as `{ID}_{number}.jpg`
* Trained model is stored in `TrainingImageLabel/Trainner.yml`

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Export to Google Sheets or Firebase
* Email summary after each day
* Add GUI with Tkinter or PyQt
* Auto-start script on boot (using `crontab` or systemd)
